The backend of the application is set up by installing the necessary Python libraries, creating a Flask app, defining routes to handle requests from the frontend, and using Beautiful Soup to extract product information from the Amazon website. SQLAlchemy is used to store the extracted data in a database, and APScheduler is used to schedule web scraping tasks.

The frontend of the application is written using the React library and uses the Axios library to send requests to the backend API. The Bootstrap or Material UI library is used to style the frontend components. Users can input the URL of the product they want to track, and the application will display a list of tracked products and their current prices. Users can also set a target price for each product and receive email alerts when the price drops below the target.

The core functionality of the application includes allowing users to input the URL of the product they want to track, extracting the current price of the product, and storing it in the database. The application also displays a list of tracked products and their current prices, and allows users to set a target price for each product and receive email alerts when the price drops below the target.
